      - question: Was the Bible mistranslated?
        answer: "Many christians in today’s church believe that homosexuality and marriage equality is a sin. They believe marriage and relationships are meant to be between one man and one woman. There are six core passages that are referenced when discussing LGBT rights and marriage equality; three in the old testament, and three in the new. The truth is the verses referenced are not discussing healthy homosexual relationships between two adult loving individuals. Let’s take a closer look at the verses listed.\n\n# Genesis 19\n\nThe story of Sodom and Gamora. The story describes two angels appearing as men arriving in the city of Sodom and being hidden in the house of Lot. A group of men from the city arrive at Lot’s house and threaten to rape the two men. The only same sex behavior described here is gang rape, not a homosexual relationship. This is not God honoring nor does it condemn homosexual relationships. This is later confirmed in Ezekiel 16:49. \n\n> “Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy.” \n\nThere is no reference here to homosexual relationships. This verse discusses the laziness and apathy of those living in Sodom. They did not love their neighbor or pursue God.\_\n\n# Leviticus 18:22 & 20:13\n\n“You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.” \"If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.” These verses are listed in the levitical laws in which many other things were listed as abominations. Some of these things include having sex while on your period, eating shelfish, charging interest on loans, and many other things we don’t consider sin today. The laws in Leviticus were fulfilled by Jesus Christ which makes us free from the old law. There are a few other theories about this verse, as it isn't as straightforward as many may think. Some say the original verse was talking about sexual exploitation, rape, and pedophillia.

Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and \n"
