      - question: At the end of the day
        answer: "At the end of the day whether or not you agree with the thoughts on this site I hope you have learned something about other people and where they are coming from. If you are a christian and believe that homosexuality is a sin then remember this, yourself and the people you love are not going to heaven based on their sin. People do not enter the kingdom of heaven based on their own merit. People go to heaven, because of their love and faith in God. What a relief that our hope is in God and not ourselves! Also itâ€™s God, who will judge us so I think we should leave that to the professional. \_\U0001F609\n"
