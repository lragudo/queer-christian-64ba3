          ## Lillian R

          Compulsatory heterosexuality caused me to ignore and supress my
          sexuality. I knew since at least highschool that I wasn't straight,
          however I believed this to be a sin and refused to acknowledge it. In
          college I had several crushes on girls that made it impossible to
          ignore. I am pansexual meaning that I am sexually and romantically
          attracted to all genders.
