      Just like anything else we need language and words to communicate to each
      other successfully. We make up new words all the time whether casually or
      for a profession or industry. We can’t interact or communicate
      successfully without language, so please take the time to learn some new
      words so you can interact and understand other people better.

          # Sexual & Romantic Orientation


          **Sexual/romantic orientation**: An inherent or immutable enduring
          emotional, romantic or sexual attraction to other people. Note: an
          individual’s sexual orientation is independent of their gender
          identity.


          **Lesbian**: A woman who is emotionally, romantically or sexually
          attracted to other women. Women and non-binary people may use this
          term to describe themselves.


          **Gay**: A person who is emotionally, romantically or sexually
          attracted to members of the same gender. Men, women and non-binary
          people may use this term to describe themselves.


          **Bisexual**: A person emotionally, romantically or sexually attracted
          to more than one sex, gender or gender identity though not necessarily
          simultaneously, in the same way or to the same degree. People may
          experience this attraction in differing ways and degrees over their
          lifetime. Bisexual people need not have had specific sexual
          experiences to be bisexual; in fact, they need not have had any sexual
          experience at all to identify as bisexual. Sometimes used
          interchangeably with pansexual.


          **Pansexual**: Describes someone who has the potential for emotional,
          romantic or sexual attraction to people of all genders though not
          necessarily simultaneously, in the same way or to the same degree.
          People may experience this attraction in differing ways and degrees
          over their lifetime. Pansexual people need not have had specific
          sexual experiences to be pansexual; in fact, they need not have had
          any sexual experience at all to identify as pansexual. Sometimes used
          interchangeably with bisexual.


          **Queer**: A term people often use to express a spectrum of identities
          and orientations that are counter to the mainstream. Queer is often
          used as a catch-all to include many people, including those who do not
          identify as exclusively straight and/or folks who have non-binary or
          genderexpansive identities. This term was previously used as a slur,
          but has been reclaimed by many parts of the LGBTQ movement.


          # Sexual & Romantic Attraction


          Sexual attraction is a spectrum. Some of us experience sexual
          attraction more than others. Those who experience sexual attraction of
          any kind are known as allosexual. On the other end of the spectrum,
          there are people who experience little to no sexual attraction. These
          people identify as aesexual. Less than 1% of the world’s population
          identify with aesexuality. Despite the common misconception, people
          who identify as aesexual or related identities, are just as capable of
          developing meaningful relations with others. There are many different
          branches of aesexuality. Here are some of the more common identities
          you may come across.


          **Asexual**: An adjective used to describe people who do not
          experience sexual attraction.


          **Graysexual**: An adjective used to describe people who experience
          some or little sexual attraction.


          **Demisexual**: An adjective used to describe people who only
          experience sexual attraction to an individual after an emotional
          connection has been established.


          Romantic attraction is also a spectrum. Much like sexual attraction,
          some experience romantic attraction differently than others. Those who
          experience romantic attraction are known as alloromantic. Those who
          experience little to no romantic attraction are known as aromantic.


          **Aromantic**: An adjective used to describe people who do not
          experience romantic attraction.


          **Grayromantic**: An adjective used to describe people who experience
          some or little romantic attraction.


          **Demiromantic**: An adjective used to describe people who only
          experience romantic attraction to an individual after an emotional
          connection has been established.


          Some individuals identify as both aesexual and aeromantic. Some
          identify as neither. Regardless of what identity people feel
          comfortable with, many of these individuals still desire connections
          with others. They are just as capable of having fulfilling
          relationships despite common misconceptions.


          # Gender Identity


          **Transgender**: An umbrella term for people whose gender identity
          and/or expression is different from cultural expectations based on the
          sex they were assigned at birth. Being transgender does not imply any
          specific sexual orientation. Therefore, transgender people may
          identify as straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual, etc.


          **Cisgender**: A term used to describe a person whose gender identity
          aligns with those typically associated with the sex assigned to them
          at birth.


          **Non-Binary**: An adjective describing a person who does not identify
          exclusively as a man or a woman. Non-binary people may identify as
          being both a man and a woman, somewhere in between, or as falling
          completely outside these categories. While many also identify as
          transgender, not all non-binary people do. Non-binary can also be used
          as an umbrella term encompassing identities such as agender, bigender,
          genderqueer or gender-fluid.


          **Agender**: Someone who doesn't identify as any particular gender.


          **Genderqueer**: Genderqueer people typically reject notions of static
          categories of gender and embrace a fluidity of gender identity and
          often, though not always, sexual orientation. People who identify as
          "genderqueer" may see themselves as being both male and female,
          neither male nor female or as falling completely outside these
          categories.


          **Gender-fluid**: A person who does not identify with a single fixed
          gender or has a fluid or unfixed gender identity.


          **Intersex**: Intersex people are born with a variety of differences
          in their sex traits and reproductive anatomy. There is a wide variety
          of difference among intersex variations, including differences in
          genitalia, chromosomes, gonads, internal sex organs, hormone
          production, hormone response, and/or secondary sex traits.
      - question: What is attraction and how do you know for sure?
        answer: >
          At face value, the answer might seem obvious. It's having a crush on
          someone right? Feeling like you just want to hang out with them, talk
          with them, be more than friends, all that right? Though that is an
          element of attraction, the real answer is a lot more nuanced than
          people realize.


          There are five different types of attraction. Sexual, romantic,
          sensual, platonic, and aesthetic. The first two are probably the most
          commonly associated with the word attraction.


          **Sexual**: Attraction on the basis of sexual desire. Many of us have
          experienced this to some degree. We see a person we find attractive
          and feel a sexual desire toward them.


          **Romantic**: Attraction based on the desire for romantic interactions
          or relationships with another person. Think of something along the
          lines of wanting to buy someone flowers, chocolates, and to shower
          them with affection.


          **Sensual**: Attraction based on the idea of non-sexual physical
          contact. It is defined as a desire to cuddle, hug, and to be close to
          someone in a non-sexual way.


          **Platonic**: Attraction defined by the desire to be friends with
          another person. It’s wanting to hang out, go out to eat, play games,
          and live life together in a platonic friend-like relationship.


          **Aesthetic**: Attraction defined as attraction simply based on
          appearance. This is probably the most simple type of attraction. It is
          as simple as noticing that a person looks aesthetically pleasing. It
          can be as simple as noticing “That person is pretty.”


          We often experience combinations of these types of attractions in our
          relationships with other people. We see this in both friendships and
          romantic relationships. With some people, we may experience all of
          these types of attractions at once. Sometimes it can be difficult to
          pinpoint the specific type of attraction we may be feeling toward a
          person. This is part of what makes sorting through feelings for others
          difficult and confusing. Hopefully these five categories may help when
          it comes to determining how we feel about another person.

          ## Lillian R

          Compulsatory heterosexuality caused me to ignore and supress my
          sexuality. I knew since at least highschool that I wasn't straight,
          however I believed this to be a sin and refused to acknowledge it. In
          college I had several crushes on girls that made it impossible to
          ignore. I am pansexual meaning that I am sexually and romantically
          attracted to all genders.
