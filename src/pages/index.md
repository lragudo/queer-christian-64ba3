      Just like anything else we need language and words to communicate to each
      other successfully. We make up new words all the time whether casually or
      for a profession or industry. We can’t interact or communicate
      successfully without language, so please take the time to learn some new
      words so you can interact and understand other people better.

          # Sexual & Romantic Orientation


          *   Sexual/romantic orientation: An inherent or immutable enduring
          emotional, romantic or sexual attraction to other people. Note: an
          individual’s sexual orientation is independent of their gender
          identity.


          *   Lesbian: A woman who is emotionally, romantically or sexually
          attracted to other women. Women and non-binary people may use this
          term to describe themselves.


          *   Gay: A person who is emotionally, romantically or sexually
          attracted to members of the same gender. Men, women and non-binary
          people may use this term to describe themselves. 


          *   Bisexual: A person emotionally, romantically or sexually attracted
          to more than one sex, gender or gender identity though not necessarily
          simultaneously, in the same way or to the same degree. People may
          experience this attraction in differing ways and degrees over their
          lifetime. Bisexual people need not have had specific sexual
          experiences to be bisexual; in fact, they need not have had any sexual
          experience at all to identify as bisexual. Sometimes used
          interchangeably with pansexual.

          ## Lillian R

          Compulsatory heterosexuality caused me to ignore and supress my
          sexuality. I knew since at least highschool that I wasn't straight,
          however I believed this to be a sin and refused to acknowledge it. In
          college I had several crushes on girls that made it impossible to
          ignore. I am pansexual meaning that I am sexually and romantically
          attracted to all genders.

      While many Christians see no problem with being queer and following God,
      many still believe that being queer and Christian can't mix.
