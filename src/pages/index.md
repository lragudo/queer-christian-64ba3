      Just like anything else we need language and words to communicate to each
      other successfully. We make up new words all the time whether casually or
      for a profession or industry. We can’t interact or communicate
      successfully without language, so please take the time to learn some new
      words so you can interact and understand other people better.

          # Sexual & Romantic Orientation


          *   **Sexual/romantic orientation**

              : An inherent or immutable enduring emotional, romantic or sexual attraction to other people. Note: an individual’s sexual orientation is independent of their gender identity.

          *   **Lesbian**
              : A woman who is emotionally, romantically or sexually attracted to other women. Women and non-binary people may use this term to describe themselves.

          *   **Gay**
              : A person who is emotionally, romantically or sexually attracted to members of the same gender. Men, women and non-binary people may use this term to describe themselves.

          *   **Bisexual**
              : A person emotionally, romantically or sexually attracted to more than one sex, gender or gender identity though not necessarily simultaneously, in the same way or to the same degree. People may experience this attraction in differing ways and degrees over their lifetime. Bisexual people need not have had specific sexual experiences to be bisexual; in fact, they need not have had any sexual experience at all to identify as bisexual. Sometimes used interchangeably with pansexual.

          *   **Pansexual**
              : Describes someone who has the potential for emotional, romantic or sexual attraction to people of all genders though not necessarily simultaneously, in the same way or to the same degree. People may experience this attraction in differing ways and degrees over their lifetime. Pansexual people need not have had specific sexual experiences to be pansexual; in fact, they need not have had any sexual experience at all to identify as pansexual. Sometimes used interchangeably with bisexual.

          *   **Queer**
              : A term people often use to express a spectrum of identities and orientations that are counter to the mainstream. Queer is often used as a catch-all to include many people, including those who do not identify as exclusively straight and/or folks who have non-binary or genderexpansive identities. This term was previously used as a slur, but has been reclaimed by many parts of the LGBTQ movement.

          # Sexual & Romantic Attraction


          Sexual attraction is a spectrum. Some of us experience sexual
          attraction more than others. Those who experience sexual attraction of
          any kind are known as allosexual. On the other end of the spectrum,
          there are people who experience little to no sexual attraction. These
          people identify as aesexual. Less than 1% of the world’s population
          identify with aesexuality. Despite the common misconception, people
          who identify as aesexual or related identities, are just as capable of
          developing meaningful relations with others. There are many different
          branches of aesexuality. Here are some of the more common identities
          you may come across.


          *   **Asexual**
              : An adjective used to describe people who do not experience sexual attraction.

          *   **Graysexual**
              : An adjective used to describe people who experience some or little sexual attraction.

          *   **Demisexual**
              : An adjective used to describe people who only experience sexual attraction to an individual after an emotional connection has been established.

          Romantic attraction is also a spectrum. Much like sexual attraction,
          some experience romantic attraction differently than others. Those who
          experience romantic attraction are known as alloromantic. Those who
          experience little to no romantic attraction are known as aromantic. 


          *   **Aromantic**
              : An adjective used to describe people who do not experience romantic attraction.

          *   **Grayromantic**
              : An adjective used to describe people who experience some or little romantic attraction.

          *   **Demiromantic**
              : An adjective used to describe people who only experience romantic attraction to an individual after an emotional connection has been established.

          Some individuals identify as both aesexual and aeromantic. Some
          identify as neither. Regardless of what identity people feel
          comfortable with, many of these individuals still desire connections
          with others. They are just as capable of having fulfilling
          relationships despite common misconceptions.

          ## Lillian R

          Compulsatory heterosexuality caused me to ignore and supress my
          sexuality. I knew since at least highschool that I wasn't straight,
          however I believed this to be a sin and refused to acknowledge it. In
          college I had several crushes on girls that made it impossible to
          ignore. I am pansexual meaning that I am sexually and romantically
          attracted to all genders.
