      - question: What is attraction and how do you know for sure?
        answer: >
          At face value, the answer might seem obvious. It's having a crush on
          someone right? Feeling like you just want to hang out with them, talk
          with them, be more than friends, all that right? Though that is an
          element of attraction, the real answer is a lot more nuanced than
          people realize.


          There are five different types of attraction. Sexual, romantic,
          sensual, platonic, and aesthetic. The first two are probably the most
          commonly associated with the word attraction.


          **Sexual**: Attraction on the basis of sexual desire. Many of us have
          experienced this to some degree. We see a person we find attractive
          and feel a sexual desire toward them.


          **Romantic**: Attraction based on the desire for romantic interactions
          or relationships with another person. Think of something along the
          lines of wanting to buy someone flowers, chocolates, and to shower
          them with affection.


          **Sensual**: Attraction based on the idea of non-sexual physical
          contact. It is defined as a desire to cuddle, hug, and to be close to
          someone in a non-sexual way.


          **Platonic**: Attraction defined by the desire to be friends with
          another person. It’s wanting to hang out, go out to eat, play games,
          and live life together in a platonic friend-like relationship.


          **Aesthetic**: Attraction defined as attraction simply based on
          appearance. This is probably the most simple type of attraction. It is
          as simple as noticing that a person looks aesthetically pleasing. It
          can be as simple as noticing “That person is pretty.”


          We often experience combinations of these types of attractions in our
          relationships with other people. We see this in both friendships and
          romantic relationships. With some people, we may experience all of
          these types of attractions at once. Sometimes it can be difficult to
          pinpoint the specific type of attraction we may be feeling toward a
          person. This is part of what makes sorting through feelings for others
          difficult and confusing. Hopefully these five categories may help when
          it comes to determining how we feel about another person.
