          ## Who we are and why we made this site


          Just two friends, who come from a christian background and had a hard
          time coming out and explaining our choices to our friends and family.
          We want to make this process a little easier for others, so began the
          process of creating QueerChristianFAQ. I want this site to be the
          beginning of a conversation. A conversation full of love, empathy, and
          understanding. Please come with an open mind and heart.

          *We could use some help writing and updating the content of the website 


          ## Disclaimer


          This is not an encyclopedia or a wiki on all things queer and
          christian. This is merely a starting point for understanding and
          clarity for those with differing beliefs. We have a generous reference
          page if you wish to learn more about any particular topic.
