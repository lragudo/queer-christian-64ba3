    questions:
      - question: Does believing in God make you a Christian?
        answer: "No it does not. Lots of people believe in God or acknowledge God’s presence. It doesn’t mean they follow Him. I acknowledge that politicians exist. It doesn’t mean I follow them. \U0001F602 \n"
      - question: What is a Christian?
        answer: >
          Someone who believes in and follows God and His word (the Bible) and
          seeks to become more like Christ.
      - question: What are the core beliefs of Christians?
        answer: >
          There are many denominations of Christianity, but most would agree
          that these are the core points of the Bible.
      - question: What is the greatest commandment in the Bible?
        answer: >
          > Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got
          together. One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this
          question: “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?”
          Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with
          all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest
          commandment. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as
          yourself.’  All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two
          commandments. (Matthew 22:34-40 ESV)


          Throughout the gospels the Sadducees and Pharisees try to trip Jesus
          up by asking difficult questions. They are trying to trap Jesus into
          saying something heretical, so that they could bring him to trial and
          execute him. I feel that many Christians do this to each other about
          all sorts of topics. We try to trap each other into saying something
          wrong, so that we can justify our own misdeeds.


          Not everyone asking difficult questions have such sinister motives as
          the Sadducees or the Pharisees. But I doubt the testing of faith for
          most queer Christians is an act completly born out of love or for
          understanding.


          My conclusion from this passage is that loving God and loving your
          neighbor, should come first before all other laws. I see it as these
          are the ones that I must do and be capable of first before I can do
          anything else in regards to the law. I also think that if you do not
          have a good foundation of these two first, how could you possibly
          fully understand any other commandment that God gives? Are the other
          ones really worth arguing about if you cannot love God and love your
          neighbor?


          Personally I still need to work on these. I’m still learning how to
          practice them and understand them better. I see so many areas of my
          life where I fall short of loving God and other people. I see people
          in my life where my heart is hard towards them and I don’t love them
          how I should. Yes I still care about the rest of the Bible, but this
          is my personal focus right now.
      - question: What about "conversion therapy"?
        answer: "Why are so many people against it? It has been found that “conversion therapy” is unlikely to produce any sort of change. Exodus International shut down, because the executive director, Alan Chambers, no longer believed that homosexuality could or should be “cured” and that 99.9% of people who had tried failed.\_\n\nAnother reason is “conversion therapy” has many unintended harmful side effects as found by the American Psychological Association Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation in 2009. These side effects include confusion, shame, guilt, helplessness, hopelessness, loss of faith, decreased self-esteem and authenticity towards others, increased self-hatred and negative perceptions, social withdrawal, a feeling of being dehumanized and untrue to self, depression, increased substance abuse and high-risk sexual behaviors, and suicidality.\n\nThe practice of “conversion therapy” is a major risk to any LGBTQ+ youth, who are twice as more likely to have attempted suicide in the previous 12 months when undergoing “comversion therapy”. Youth are also often forced to go to “conversion therapy” against their will, being threaten by their family members, who will cut off contact and support unless they agree to attend.\_\n\nIn the end “conversion therapy” is the cause of self-destructive behaviors in LGBTQ+ people.\_\n\nThis has been a summary of [A Christian Case Against LGBTQ Change Efforts](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5faeade71e53e609dae94549/t/5fdbd70a13ab682639a97928/1608242955528/The+Good+Fruit+Project+Guide+%7C+Q+Christian+Fellowship+%26+The+Trevor+Project.pdf) by the Good Fruit Project.
