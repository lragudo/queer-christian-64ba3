          # Brene Brown


          If you want to learn more about people, other perspectives, and how to
          connect and understand others then you should definitely follow her.
          She has an awesome podcast called Unlocking Us! It has been deep,
          meditative, and healing for me.


          > "Conversations that unlock the deeply human part of who we are, so
          that 

          > we can live, love, parent, and lead with more courage and heart. "
