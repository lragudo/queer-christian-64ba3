      - question: Other Awesome People to Follow
        answer: >
          # Teresa & Travis McElroy


          This wife and husband duo have a great podcast called Shmanners. It is
          about extraordinary etiquette for ordinary occasions. They first talk
          about the history of a topic and then answer questions sent in by
          their listeners. Sometimes they also do biographies. They have a nice
          episode where they have a conversation with their LGBTQ+ friends on
          dating. If you’re queer and nervous about dating this is a great
          episode to listen to.

          If you want to learn more about people, other perspectives, and how to
          connect and understand others then you should definitely follow her.
          She has an awesome podcast called Unlocking Us! It has been deep,
          meditative, and healing for me.


          > "Conversations that unlock the deeply human part of who we are, so
          that

          > we can live, love, parent, and lead with more courage and heart. "
